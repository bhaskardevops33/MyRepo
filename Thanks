Hi Abhishek Anna,

Please do not post this into any social media platforms..


I just wanted to reach out and say a big thank you for the fantastic content on your YouTube channel. As someone who moved from a network admin role to a DevOps engineer, your videos were a game-changer for me.

I had invested some amount  in an online course but still struggled with DevOps concepts. Your clear and practical explanations made everything click for me. Because of your content, I successfully transitioned to a DevOps role and even got a 120% salary increase.

Your work has had a significant impact on my career, and I'm truly grateful. Please keep up the excellent work!

i can explain my emotion better, if i get a chance to speak to you in phone,


Thanks again,

Bhaskar
